Hi, there! 👋🏼

I renamed my GitHub account from `@Gabriel439` to `@Gabriella439`, so if you got here from an old profile link you can visit my new profile here:

* [`@Gabriella439`](http://github.com/Gabriella439)

I created this placeholder account so that:

* … people who visit old links to my profile can find my new profile
* … other people cannot impersonate my old handle
* … GitHub continues to redirect old links to my repositories indefinitely
